On July 1st 2020 the project branched into https://github.com/diafyt/lazarus

# Help with COVID

The project originates from **Help with COVID** request for volunteers: https://helpwithcovid.com where volunteers commit time and resources free of charge to contribute to an open source project.
If you have not signed up yet and want to contribute please add your profile at https://helpwithcovid.com/projects/385-identify-covid-19-coronavirus-symptoms-in-type-1-diabetics

# Dear Volunteer, 
 
Thank you very much for offering help. Your time is highly appreciated. We received offers to help from an overwhelming number of people  with extraordinary talents. 

# What does this project do?

Problem being diabetic:
Diabetes makes patients more vulnerable to infection, both bacterial and viral. This is because an elevated blood glucose provides an environment for microorganisms to thrive and multiply. Not only that, but elevated blood glucose interrupts the ability of our white blood cells to fight infection.

What we can do:
We would be able to build a coronavirus enabled app in  3 month or less for US and patients worldwide. 
1. develop AI on top of existing AI with COVID functionality
2. develop interfaces to all CGM glucose sensors, build hacks if needed and to speed up availability to patients
3. design and build IOS release
4. build COVID release for Android (add-on for existing app)
4. FDA fast track or use EU certification CE mark
5. clinical trial
6. rollout to patients in the US, EU, world

How does this helps:
Patients can be informed when symptoms of an infection occur. This leads to a lower risk of getting infected and reduces the severity of the disease in the event of an infection.

How do we start:
We broke down the original project in smaller parts to make it a bit more easy to manage and get results as fast as possible:

# ctm
What does this project do?
design and build a continuous body temperature monitor (CTM) 
more info at: https://github.com/vthomw/ctm/wiki/what-is-it-we-are-going-to-build

How do I get started?
become familiar with the topic of CGM, NFC/RFID, App developemnt, ML for data analysis. Read what we post on Wiki. Browse Issues and let us know what you find interesting. Ask if you need info. Another option is to read the beginners guide if you are new to GitHub: https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/

Where can I get more help, if I need it?
We did open a SLACK channel for discussion. Please sign-up at https://helpwithcovid.com/projects/385-identify-covid-19-coronavirus-symptoms-in-type-1-diabetics and I'll add your email address to the slack channel.

# 15693
What does this project do?
Development NFC 15693 tag emulation for test automation of CGM/CTM NFC tags, integrate with Android development environment 


Why is this project useful?
Intense testing is required during the project however is very time consuming. Therefore test automation is needed. However this becaums challenging if you have hardware. Therfore a hardware emulator can be integrated into automated test cases and speed up testing by a magnitude.

How do I get started?
raise your hand and we will provide exsiting code, ISO documentation and some guidence. You can start reading about NFC, RFID, PROXCON, Android Studio automated testing
